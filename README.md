# WinFormMarkup

A more concise, flexible, and extensible syntax for working with .Net Core Windows Forms.

Inspired by [TornadoFX][1] and [Xamarin Community Toolkit C# Markup][2].  WinFormMarkup is a set of extension methods that make it easier to create Windows Forms in a cleaner, more declarative manner.

Don't be dependent on an IDE designer.  Make cleaner forms.  Not every UI control needs a member variable.
